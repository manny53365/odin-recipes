        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <ol>Gather all your ingredients.</ol>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <ol>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</ol>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <ol>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </ol>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </ol>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <ol>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</ol>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <ol>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <ol>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </ol>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <ol>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </ol>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <ol>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</ol>
            <h3>Step 10</h3>
            <ol>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</ol>
