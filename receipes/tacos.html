        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade taco shells are crunchy and taste excellent! Use homemade tortillas or store-bought corn tortillas. You may need a little practice at first. Fill and serve tacos right after frying, or they may become chewy. Leftovers may be heated in the oven for crisping.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <ol>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</ol>
            <ol>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</ol>
            <ol>salt to taste</ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <ol>Fill a heavy skillet with 1-inch-deep oil over medium heat; heat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).</ol>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <ol>Fry one tortilla at a time in hot oil. Cook for about 15 seconds. Flip over and fold in half, holding in place with tongs until crispy, about 15 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot.</ol>
        </ul>
